Problem Statement
Read carefully and implement the solution

React Challenge – "CourseCatalog SPA"
1 Scenario
Your academy's marketing team wants a public preview of its course catalog. They need:

a homepage that lists courses from a demo API
the ability to mark favourites
per‑course details on its own route
basic theme toggle and pagination
good perceived speed
They'll replace the API and styling later; you just deliver a solid technical spike.

2 Feature ↔ Concept Matrix
| Required Concept | Where to demonstrate it | | --- | --- | | Vite + JSX & Babel | Scaffold with npm create vite@latest course‑catalog -- --template react. | | Components, props, VDOM | <CourseCard>, <Pagination>, <FavouriteBadge> etc. | | useState | Track filter text, "dark mode", current page. | | Axios + APIs | GET https://dummyjson.com/products (or any open JSON source). | | useEffect + Lifecycles | Fetch courses on mount & when page changes. | | Context API | ThemeContext to toggle light/dark across the tree. | | React Router | / (list) • /course/:id (details). | | useRef + Pagination | searchInputRef.current.focus() after page change; maintain currentPage with refs to avoid stale closures if you like. | | useReducer (advanced state) | Handle complex favourite‑list actions: {type:'add', id} / {type:'remove', id}. | | Redux (+ middleware) | Optional: migrate the favourites reducer into Redux with @reduxjs/toolkit; use redux‑thunk to simulate async write to localStorage. | | Performance optimisation | Lazy load detail page (React.lazy + Suspense), wrap CourseCard in React.memo, and useCallback handlers to prevent re‑renders. |

3 Functional Requirements
Course List Page (/)
Fetch courses (limit=10&skip=(page‑1)\*10).
Render cards (title, price, thumbnail).
Paginate with <Prev/Next> (client‑side calculation).
Filter by title (case‑insensitive) via a search input.
Course Detail Page (/course/:id)
Lazy‑loaded route component.
Fetch single course data; show specs & "Add to Favourites" button.
Favourites Sidebar
Global list via useReducer or Redux.
Persist to localStorage; hydrate on load.
Show badge count in header.
Theme Toggle
Button switches CSS class (light / dark) stored in Context.
Remember preference in localStorage.
Performance Touches
React.memo on CourseCard.
Code‑split detail page.
Use useRef for stable scroll‑to‑top on page change.

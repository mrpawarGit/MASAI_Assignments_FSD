Q: 15 Title: - Inventory Management System: Tracking Low Stock and Reordering

Problem Statement:
You are building an Inventory Management System for a store. You have an array of product objects, where each product contains the following properties: name, category, stock, and pricePerUnit. Your task is to perform a series of operations to track and manage low-stock items and reorder supplies efficiently. Follow the steps below:

Steps:

1.Filter the products to find items where the stock is less than 100.
2.Map these low-stock products to create an array that includes the product name, category, and 
  the total reorder cost (which is pricePerUnit * (100 - current stock)). This represents how much it will cost to reorder enough stock to bring the item back to 100 units.
3.Group the products by category and reduce the data to find the total reorder cost per 
  category.
4.Return an object where each key is the product category, and the value is the total reorder 
  cost for that category.

Extra Challenges:
Ensure that only categories with at least one low-stock product are included.
Sort the categories in descending order of total reorder costs.

Example:

Input: [

{ name: "Laptop", category: "Electronics", stock: 50, pricePerUnit: 1000 },

{ name: "Phone", category: "Electronics", stock: 150, pricePerUnit: 500 },

{ name: "T-shirt", category: "Clothing", stock: 40, pricePerUnit: 20 },

{ name: "Jeans", category: "Clothing", stock: 90, pricePerUnit: 40 },

{ name: "Watch", category: "Accessories", stock: 70, pricePerUnit: 150 } ]

Output: {

"Electronics": 50000, // Laptop needs 50 more units * $1000 per unit

"Clothing": 2000, // T-shirt needs 60 more units * $20 + Jeans needs 10 more units * $40

"Accessories": 4500 // Watch needs 30 more units * $150 }

Explanation:

-Electronics: Only the laptop is low on stock, and it needs 50 more units, costing $50,000.
-Clothing: The T-shirt and Jeans are both low on stock. T-shirt needs 60 more units ($1,200), 
 and Jeans need 10 more units ($400), so the total for "Clothing" is $2,000.
-Accessories: The Watch needs 30 more units, costing $4,500.

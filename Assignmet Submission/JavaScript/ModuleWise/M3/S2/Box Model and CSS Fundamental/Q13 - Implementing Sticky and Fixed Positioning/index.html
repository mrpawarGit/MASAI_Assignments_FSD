  <h2>What Exactly is Web Development?</h2>
  <b>Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications.</b>
  <p>It involves various aspects, including web design, programming, and database management. Essentially, it's the work
    of bringing a
    website or web-based application from an idea to a functional online experience.</p>
  <p>
    Here's a more detailed breakdown:
  </p>
  <p>
    Core Areas:
    Frontend Development:
    Focuses on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) that users interact with directly in their browsers.
    This
    includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which control the look, feel, and interactivity of a website.
    Backend Development:
    Handles the "behind-the-scenes" aspects of a website, including data processing, storage, and logic. This often
    involves server-side programming languages and database management.
    Full Stack Development:
    A combination of both frontend and backend development, where a single developer has expertise in both areas.
  </p>

  <p>
    Key Tasks:
    Website Coding: Writing the code that structures and styles a website using languages like HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript.
    Technical Design: Planning and implementing the technical architecture of a website, including its layout,
    functionality, and performance.
    Database Management: Designing, creating, and maintaining databases to store and retrieve website data.
    Content Management: Creating and managing the content that is displayed on a website.
    Performance Optimization: Ensuring a website loads quickly and functions efficiently.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tools and Technologies:
    Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Java, and more.
    Frameworks and Libraries: React, Angular, Vue.js, jQuery (frontend), Node.js, Spring, Django (backend).
    Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
    Content Management Systems (CMS): WordPress, Drupal, Joomla.
    Code Editors/IDE: VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom.

  <p>Web development is closely related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and apps
    (often called “web design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual construction and
    programming of websites and apps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think of all the web pages you have used over the years – Web Developers built those sites, making sure they
    functioned properly and performed in ways that allowed for a great user experience. Web Developers do this by
    writing lines of code, using a variety of programming languages, which vary depending on the tasks they are
    performing and the platforms they are working on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Web Designers:

    Create everything a user sees on a website or software product, including all visual, color, typography, and
    usability elements
    Work directly with a client to create designs or work as part of a team to develop client vision
    May need knowledge of a programming language or some coding skills, or at least some level of familiarity with
    widely used languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript
    Create wireframes and prototypes to test design ideas, offer input on design logos, branding, company style guides.
  </p>

  <p>
    A Full-Stack Developer is someone familiar with both front- and back-end development. Full Stack Developers usually
    understand a wide variety of programming languages and because of their versatility, they might be given more of a
    leadership role on projects than developers who specialize. They are generalists, adept at wearing both hats, and
    familiar with every layer of development. Obviously, employers want to hire Full-Stack Developers according to an
    Indeed study, they are the fourth-most in-demand job in tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the title is contentious, it’s in the generalist nature of the position. Developers who specialize in the
    front-end or back-end often bristle at the notion that someone could be equally adept at both – the expression
    “jack-of-all-trades, master of none” comes to mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    And with demand for Developers expected to grow 15 percent by 2026 (for 24,400 new jobs), much faster than the U.S.
    average rate of job growth, there may not be a better time to dive in and learn more about all the layers of Web
    Development.

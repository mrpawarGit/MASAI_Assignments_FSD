/**
Q: 8 Title: Fetch and Display Products with Error Handling

Problem Statement:
Create a product listing page that fetches data from the 
FakeStoreAPI (https://fakestoreapi.com/products) and displays the product details in a 
grid format. Each product should show its image, title, price, and a button 
labeled "View Details". If the API call fails (e.g., an incorrect URL is used), 
display a user-friendly error message.

Key Requirements:
    1. Fetch data from the API using the Fetch API and display the products in console dynamically.
    2. Implement error handling to display a message like "Failed to fetch products. 
       Please try again later" when the API call fails.
    3. Use a try-catch block to handle errors with async/await.
    4. Finally implement reduce method to calculate the sum of all the products price . 
       But make sure that you're using reduce method to do so , if not then the assignment 
       will be flagged as Not - Submitted

Q: 12
Title: Implementing setTimeout for Delayed Messages

Problem Statement:
Write a JavaScript program that uses setTimeout to print a delayed message to the console. Your code should:
  1.Print "Message 1" immediately.
  2.Use setTimeout to print "Message 2 after 2 seconds" after a delay of 2 seconds.
  3.Print "Message 3" immediately after "Message 1".

The output order should reflect asynchronous execution: first "Message 1", then "Message 3", followed by "Message 2 after 2 seconds" after the delay.
*/

console.log("Message 1")

setTimeout(()=>{
  console.log("Message 2 after 2 seconds")
},2000)

console.log("Message 2")

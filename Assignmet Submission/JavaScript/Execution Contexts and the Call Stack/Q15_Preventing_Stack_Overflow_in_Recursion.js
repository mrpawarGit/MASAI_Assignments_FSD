Q: 15
Title: L2 - Preventing_Stack_Overflow_in_Recursion

Problem Statement:
You are required to write a recursive function factorial to calculate the factorial of a given number. However, you also need to handle potential stack overflow issues by adding a check to prevent an infinite recursion in case of incorrect input or base cases. Specifically, ensure that:

1. If the input number is negative, print "Invalid input".
2. If the input is not a number, print "Invalid input".
3. Use recursion to compute the factorial for valid inputs.
4. Include a base case to stop the recursion at factorial(0).
5. You will implement a safety mechanism that prevents a stack overflow by avoiding incorrect
   recursive calls.

Steps:

1.Write a function factorial that calculates the factorial of a number.
2.Make sure that you read about Recursion in MDN (it's an interesting topics).
3.Include checks for negative numbers and non-numeric input.
4.Use recursion with a base case to avoid stack overflow.
5.Test with multiple inputs to demonstrate correctness and safety.

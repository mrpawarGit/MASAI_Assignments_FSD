Q: 1 Online Learning Platform - Course Completion Analysis

Problem Statement:
An online learning platform tracks students' progress.

Requirements:
const studentsProgress = [
  { name: "Ramesh", completedLessons: 40, totalLessons: 50 },
  { name: "Sita", completedLessons: 25, totalLessons: 50 },
  { name: "Manoj", completedLessons: 30, totalLessons: 60 },
  { name: "Pooja", completedLessons: 48, totalLessons: 50 },
  { name: "Anil", completedLessons: 15, totalLessons: 50 }
];

Implement the following logic:
-Filter students who have completed at least 50% of the course.
-Map to calculate their completion percentage.
-Reduce to find the average completion percentage of all active students.
-Filter students who have more than 80% completion to get a list of top learners.

Expected Output:
-List of active students with their completion percentage.
-The average course completion percentage.

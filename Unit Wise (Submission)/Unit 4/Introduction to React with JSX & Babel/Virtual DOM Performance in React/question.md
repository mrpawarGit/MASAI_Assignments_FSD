Title:
L1 - Virtual DOM Performance in React

Problem Statement:
Build a React application that demonstrates how React's Virtual DOM works more efficiently than the traditional DOM.

Create two buttons:
"Change Title (Vanilla JS)": This button changes the webpage's title using direct DOM manipulation.
"Change Title (React)": This button changes the webpage's title using React state.
Add functionality to count and display the number of DOM updates each button triggers.
Hint: Use state in React and JavaScript variables for vanilla DOM updates.

Submission Guidelines:
Submit a folder containing the React application and a plain HTML+JS file for vanilla DOM.
Submission has to be done via Masai Github repo offcourse .

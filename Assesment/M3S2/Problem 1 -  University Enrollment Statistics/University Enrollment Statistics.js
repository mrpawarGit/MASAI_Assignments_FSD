Input:

[
  { departmentName: "Computer Science", location: "Building A", students: [21, 22, 20, 23, 22] },
  { departmentName: "Mechanical", location: "Building B", students: [24, 25, 24, 23] },
  { departmentName: "Civil", location: "Building C", students: [22, 22] }
]

Expected Output:

  Total students:
  Computer Science: 5
  Mechanical: 4
  Civil: 2

Department with max students: "Computer Science" (5 students)
Departments with less than 30 students: ["Computer Science", "Mechanical", "Civil"]
